#Data Science from Scratch 
#2017-02-22

##<Preface>##

Data scientist has been called, 'the sexiest job of the 21st century.'
**What is data scientist?**
According to a Venn diagram, data science lies at the intersection of:
Hacking skills/ Math and statistics knowledge/ Substantive expertise

, and this book focuses on the first two traits.

>Playing with data is fun! (Especially compared to some of the alternatives, like tax preparation or coal mining.)

>All she needs is an inquisitiv emind, a willingness to work hard, and this book. Hence this book.


##1. Introduction##

**The Ascendence of Data**

Let's find some answers that no one's ever thought to ask, under the enormous data world.

**What Is Data Science?**

>We'll say that a data scientist is someone who extracts insights from messy data. Today's world is full of people trying to turn data into insight.

>But it certainly won't hurt your career if you like figuring out the best way to get people to click on advertisements.

**Motivating Hypothetical: DataSciencester**

>Welcome aboard, and good luck! (You're allowed to wear jeans on Friday, and the bathroom is down the hall on the right.)

**Finding Key Connectors**

>In particular, he wnats you to identify who the "key connectors" are among data scientists.
>(which, in one of the great cosmic coincidentces, rhymes with the user's id)

**Salaries and Experience**

**Paid Account**

##2. A Crah Course in Python##

**Whitespace Fromatting**

**Modules**
Certain features of Python are not loaded in first hand, which requres additional work, so called, 'import'. 

-simpoly import 
-when there were need a number of typing, add 'as sth'
-when in need of a few specific values form a module, import explicitly by 'from A import B'

**Arithmatic**

**Functions**

-A function is a rule for taking zero or more inputs and returning a corresponding output.
-Star with 'def' and never forget to add the ':', mostly ends with 'return'
-Python functions are *first-class*, which means that we can assign them to variables and pass them into functions just like any other arguemnts: *I don't get this*
-Both indicate same functional performance.     
     \'another_double = lambda x: 2*x\'
     \'def another_double(x): return 2*x\'

**Strings**

-Strings can be delimited by single or doulbe quotation marks, but the quotes have to match)

**Exceptions**

-Handle the exceptions, raised by Python since there were something wrong in the code, using 'try' and 'except'
